# All-Path
This algorithm searches for the shortest path between 2 nodes in any given graph by indexing the nodes.
This is done by using logical operations on each column of the adjacency matrix, representation a node's adjacent nodes, with every other column

# Searching
Once the graph has been indexed the indexed value can be manipulated to obtain the starting node, the ending node, and any node that must be traveled between them
